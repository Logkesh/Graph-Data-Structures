# Graph-Data-Structures

## For the given network, the above code does the following:

### a.	Constructs the Adjacency List, matrix and Map based graph and print the number of vertices and edges 
### b.	Computes the Minimum Spanning tree using prim and Kruskal algorithm.
### c.	Gives the list of strongly connected components and display the number of Strongly connected components.
### d.	Displays the largest strongly connected components (SCC) and display the number of vertices and edges in SCC
### e.	Displays the diameter of the (longest shortest path)
### f.	Display the path from every vertex in the ascending order.
### g.	If the graph is acyclic, then perform topological sorting.
